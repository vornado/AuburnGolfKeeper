<h1>About Us </h1>
<p> Our organization is a platform for golfers by golfers. We wanted to create a platform that allows golfers to keep track of all their scores at any course they have played. We included golf handicaps in the scoring too. We created this platform to help make life easier for the golfers to keep track of their scores and have fun doing it. </p>
